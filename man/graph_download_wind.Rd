\arguments{
\item{pam}{PAM logger dataset list with \code{pam$sta} computed. See \code{\link[=pam_read]{pam_read()}} and \code{\link[=pam_sta]{pam_sta()}}.}

\item{area}{Geographical extent of the map to query. Either a raster (e.g. \code{static_prob}) or a
list ordered by North, West, South, East  (e.g. \code{c(50,-16,0,20)}).}

\item{sta_id}{stationary period identifier of the \emph{start} of the flight to query as defined in
\code{pam$sta}.}

\item{cds_key}{user (email address) used to sign up for the ECMWF data service. See
\code{\link[=wf_set_key]{wf_set_key()}}.}

\item{cds_user}{token provided by ECMWF. See \code{\link[=wf_set_key]{wf_set_key()}}.}

\item{path}{path were to store the downloaded data.}
}
\value{
the path of the downloaded (requested file)

\description{
This function wrap the function Wind data is available at high resolution (1hr, 0.25Â°, 37 pressure level) on ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels. And this data is easily accessible through the ecmwfr package. As the flight are of short duration, we suggest to download a file for each flight.
}
\details{
area

Be default download data for all the flight, thus sta_id is all exetpt the last one (no flight starting from the last stationary period)
