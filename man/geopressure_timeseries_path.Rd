\title{Query the timeseries of pressure from a path and geolocator pressure}
\usage{
geopressure_timeseries_path(
  path,
  pressure,
  include_flight = FALSE,
  workers = 90,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A data.frame of the position containing latitude (\code{lat}), longitude  (\code{lon}) and the
stationary period id (\code{stap}) as column.}

\item{pressure}{Pressure list from data logger dataset list.}

\item{include_flight}{Extend request to also query the pressure and altitude during the previous
and/or next flight. Flights are defined by a \code{stap=0}. Accept Logical or vector of -1 (previous
flight), 0 (stationary) and/or 1 (next flight). (e.g. \code{include_flight=c(-1, 1)} will only search
for the flight before and after but not the stationary period). Note that next and previous
flights are defined by the +/1 of the \code{stap} value (and not the previous/next \code{stap} value).}

\item{workers}{number of parrellel request on GEE. Between 1 and 99.}

\item{verbose}{Display (or not) the progress of the queries (logical).}
}
\value{
List of data.frame containing for each stationary period, the date, pressure, altitude
(same as \code{\link[=geopressure_timeseries]{geopressure_timeseries()}}).
}
\description{
This function runs in parallel \code{geopressure_timeseries()} based on a path and pressure timeserie.
It uses the \code{stap} to match the pressure timeseries to request for each position of the path.
}
\details{
You can include previous and/or next flight period in each query. This is typically useful to
estimate flight altitude with greater precision.

If a position of the path is over water, it will be moved to the closest point onshore as
explained in \code{geopressure_timeseries()}.
