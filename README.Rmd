The goal of GeoPressureR is to help researcher to analyse pressure measurement from geolocator. Firstly, it provides a R wrapper around the [GeoPressure API](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureServer) to query the probability map using ERA5 pressure. Secondly, using a mathematical graph, it allows you to model the trajectory producing the exact probability map at stationary period and simulating paths. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of GeoPressureR from [GitHub](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureR) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Rafnuss/GeoPressureR")
```

## Where to start?

Using the example of a Great Reed Warbler (18LX), the vignettes were designed to guide you through all the steps with great details.

The vignette [Pressure map](./articles/pressure-map.html) is a good place to understand the basic workflow used to compute a proability map from pressure measurement. It will guide you through all the steps.

Once the probability maps are computed, [the vignette on graph](./articles/basic-graph.html) will help you create the graph and compute the three outputs: the most likely trajectory, the (posteriori) probability map of each stationary period and simulation of possible path.
