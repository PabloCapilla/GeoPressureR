The goal of GeoPressureR is to help researcher to analyse pressure measurement from geolocator. 

- Part 1: Firstly, it provides a R wrapper around the [GeoPressure API](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureServer) to query the probability map using ERA5 pressure. 
- Part 2: Secondly, using a mathematical graph, it allows you to model the trajectory producing the exact probability map at stationary period and simulating paths.

## Installation

You can install the development version of GeoPressureR from [GitHub](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureR) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Rafnuss/GeoPressureR")
```

## Where to start?

Using the example of a Great Reed Warbler (18LX), the vignettes were designed to guide you through all the steps with great details.

The vignette [Pressure map](./articles/pressure-map.html) is a good place to understand the basic workflow used to compute a probability map from pressure measurement (part 1). It will guide you (or redirect you) through all the steps from the loading the data, labeling of the timeseries, querying the ERA5 pressure map and finally computing the likelihood map.  

Once the probability maps are computed, the vignette [Basic graph](./articles/basic-graph.html) will help you create the graph and compute three main outputs: (1) the most likely trajectory, (2) the (posterior) probability map of each stationary period and (3) simulation of possible path.
