The goal of GeoPressureR is to help researcher to analyse pressure measurement from geolocator. In particular, it provides a R wrapper around the [GeoPressure API](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureServer) to query the proability map using ERA5 pressure.

## Installation

You can install the development version of GeoPressureR from [GitHub](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureR) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Rafnuss/GeoPressureR")
```

## Where to start?

The [vignette basic esample](./basic_example.html) is probably the best place to understand the basic workflow of the package.
