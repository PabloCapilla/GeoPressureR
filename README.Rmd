`GeoPressureR` seeks to help researchers analyse data retrieved from multi-sensor geolocators to accurately geoposition birds along their migratory journey. We focus in particular on geopositiong using atomspheric pressure measurements.

Part 1 provides an R wrapper around the [GeoPressureAPI](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureAPI) to generate probability maps of the bird's position based on a match between the pressure timeseries measured by the geolocator and the reanalysed pressure data from [ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5). See the publication [10.21203/rs.3.rs-1381915/v2](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1381915/v2) for more details.

Part 2 uses a graphical model to compute the full trajectory of the bird building on light data, pressure measurements, flight duration and wind data (optional). See the publication [10.21203/rs.3.rs-1693751/v1](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1693751/v1) for more details.

**`GeoPressureR` is currently still in active development phase.**

## Where to start?

### Learn about `GeoPressureR` with 18LX

Using the example of a Great Reed Warbler (18LX), we developed a series of [vignettes](https://r-pkgs.org/vignettes.html) to guide you through each step in detail.

The [Pressure map](/articles/pressure-map.html) vignette is a good place to start to understand the basic workflow used to compute a probability map from pressure measurements (Part 1). It guides you through each step, from loading the data, to labeling the timeseries, querying the ERA5 pressure map and finally computing the probability map.

Once the probability maps are computed, the [Basic graph](/articles/basic-graph.html) vignette helps you create the graph and compute three main outputs: (1) the most likely trajectory, (2) the (posterior) probability map of each stationary period and (3) a simulation of possible paths (Part 2).

Finally, the [Wind graph](/articles/wind-graph.html) vignette extends the capability of the basic graph to include wind data and refine possible flight distances. It also allows to estimate wind support, airspeed, and energy expenditure for each flight.

### Start your own analysis

To help you start using `GeoPressureR` for your own study, we suggest you use the R template [GeoPressureTemplate](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureTemplate). Using this standardized code structure and output will allow for code sharing and troubleshooting, data archiving, work reproducibility, and ease for reviewer to check the setting.
