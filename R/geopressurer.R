#' GeoPressureR: Global positioning by atmospheric pressure.
#'
#' GeoPressureR is a R package which help researchers determine the position of a bird based on the
#' data retrieved from multi-sensor geolocators.
#'
#' The main novelty of this package is to match atmospheric pressure measurements to weather
#' reanalysis database (ERA-5) and produce a probability maps of position.
#'
#' In addition, we use a graphical model to combine pressure, light, acceleration and windspeed
#' data into a trajectory model of the bird.
